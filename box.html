    <h1>CSS</h1> was initially released in 1996 and is currently developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="http://localhost/html/box.html">W3C</a>). Web developers and designers utilize CSS files to create a similar appearance across webpages on a site. By storing display properties for multiple pages in a single file, CSS files also reduce the amount of work and generated HTML code.
